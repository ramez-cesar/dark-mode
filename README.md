# Add a dark mode to your website!

This repository contains a small project that you can use to add a dark mode to your website without worrying that when you reload the page, the dark mode will be lost because it has been integrated with LocalStorage. 

Adapt it to your project!

If you have any questions or comments, you can [contact me](mailto:cesarramez8@gmail.com).
